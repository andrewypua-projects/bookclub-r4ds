# Web scraping

** Learning objectives **

1.    Learn a bit of HTML 
2.    Use that bit of HTML to learn web scraping. 

## Curious features of the chapter

-   No exercises!
-   Ethical implications of web scraping
-   Using an external tool like SelectorGadget
-   Limitations of scraping for dynamic websites

## Typical HTML structure

-   HTML has hierarchical structure.
-   Structure is composed of elements. 
-   Each element has
    -   Start tag
    -   Attributes
    -   Content
    -   End tag
-   Each element can have children which are themselves elements.
-   Consistency of structure enables one to do web scraping. 

## Key commands to extract data from HTML

-   Key package: `rvest`
-   Load html to scrape: `read_html()`
-   Extract data through selectors
    -   `html_elements()`, `html_element()`
    -   `html_attr()`
    -   `html_text2()`
-   Extract data from HTML tables: `html_table()`

## Example: Loading IMDB data

-   Load packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

-   This code chunk may be a bottleneck for people with slower internet connections and for websites which may guard against scraping.

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
# Problem directly using code from book
url <- "https://web.archive.org/web/20220201012049/https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/"
html <- read_html(url)
```

-   Download HTML file locally instead. Then use `read_html()` directly on the downloaded file.

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
# Suggestion from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33295686/rvest-error-in-open-connectionx-rb-timeout-was-reached
download.file(url, destfile = "scrapedpage.html", quiet=TRUE)
html.book <- read_html("scrapedpage.html")
```

-   Specific to the Internet Archive is that some of the website snapshots may be available as a link but not necessarily accessible.

-   May encounter 403 Forbidden error. 

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
# Not just any URL will work
url <- "https://web.archive.org/web/20240223185506/https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/"
download.file(url, destfile = "scrapedpage.html", quiet=TRUE)
``` 

-   But even if that were the case, the scraped file may part of a dynamic website. 
-   A very old snapshot is available for comparison.

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
url <- "https://web.archive.org/web/20040704034814/https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/"
download.file(url, destfile = "scrapedpage-old.html", quiet=TRUE)
```

-   But the structure of the website and the associated HTML have changed. 
-   This means the code you see in the book will not work out of the box. 

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
html.old <- read_html("/home/apua/Documents/r4ds/scrapedpage-old.html")
temp <- html.old |> 
  html_elements("table") |> html_attr("border") 
which(temp == "1")
temp <- html.old |> 
  html_elements("table") 
table.old <- html_table(temp[21], header=TRUE)
ratings <- table.old[[1]] |>
  select(
    rank = "Rank",
    title_year = "Title",
    rating = "Rating",
    votes = "Votes"
  ) |> 
  mutate(votes = parse_number(votes)) |>
  separate_wider_regex(
    title_year,
    patterns = c(
      title = ".+", " +\\(",
      year = "\\d+", "\\)"
    )
  )
ratings
```

-   Let us compare to the book. 

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
html.book <- read_html("scrapedpage.html")
table.book <- html.book |> 
  html_element("table") |> 
  html_table()
ratings.book <- table.book |>
  select(
    rank_title_year = `Rank & Title`,
    rating = `IMDb Rating`
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    rank_title_year = str_replace_all(rank_title_year, "\n +", " "), 
    rating_n = html.book |> html_elements("td strong") |> html_attr("title")
  ) |> 
  separate_wider_regex(
    rank_title_year,
    patterns = c(
      rank = "\\d+", "\\. ",
      title = ".+", " +\\(",
      year = "\\d+", "\\)"
    )
  ) |>
  separate_wider_regex(
    rating_n,
    patterns = c(
      "[0-9.]+ based on ",
      number = "[0-9,]+",
      " user ratings"
    )
  ) |>
    mutate(
    number = parse_number(number)
  )
ratings.book$title
```

-   Let point out things about the two datasets which make post-processing challenging.  
-   I don't resolve them here, but they require one to think about what questions you want answered first. 

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
ratings$title
left_join(ratings, ratings.book, by="title")
```

## Example: Quarantine Zine Club

-   Task is to create a spreadsheet where we have the titles of the zines, their authors, the links to download the zines, and the first social media link of the authors. 
-   Used `xpath` here, but was not discussed in book. 
-   The code chunk below should work but gives an error when processed at Github repo of bookclub-r4ds, but it works on my machine. I have yet to figure out why. 

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
url <- "https://quarantinezineclub.neocities.org/zinelibrary"
html <- read_html(url) 
zinelib <- tibble(authors = html |> html_elements("#zname") |> html_text2(), 
       titles = html |> html_elements("#libraryheader") |> html_text2(),
       pdflink = html |> 
  html_elements(xpath = "//div[@class='column right']") |> html_element("a") |> html_attr("href"),
       mark = 2:156
       )
get.first.social <- function(num)
{
  return(html |> html_elements(xpath = paste("/html/body/div[2]/div[", num, "]/div[2]/a[1]", sep = ""))|> html_attr("href"))
}
zinelib <- zinelib |> mutate(
  pdflink = paste("https://quarantinezineclub.neocities.org/", pdflink, sep = ""),
  social1 = get.first.social(mark)) |> select(-mark)
zinelib
```
